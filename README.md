# chibicc-6800-v1: A Small C Compiler for MC6800

This project is a fork of [@rui314](https://www.sigbus.info/)'s [chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/), modified to create a C compiler for the Motorola MC6800 architecture.

This project was created as a tool for studying compilers for the MC6800, and while it includes extra code and comments that may not be essential, they reflect the learning process and experimentation involved in developing the compiler.

There are many aspects of the object code generation method and speed that cannot be understood without actually creating it. There may be unnecessary parts added for testing code generation.

However, it is a compiler that works reasonably well. I hope it will be helpful for you to create another fork.

Dhrystone & Whetstone works now.

# Topics

- **Data types:** `int` and pointers are 16-bit; `long` and `float` are 32-bit. `double` and `long long` (64-bit or more) are unsupported.
- **Structs/unions:** Passing/returning by value and bit fields are implemented.
- **Function parameters:** Only the first parameter is passed via registers (A/B/@long). If the first parameter is a struct/union, all parameters are passed via the stack.
- **Return values:** Struct/union return values pass their address as an implicit first argument in a register. all other normal arguments are passed on the stack.

The compiler passes basic tests, but there are still many issues remaining.

IEEE 754 32-bit floating-point arithmetic code is written in assembler, which is faster and also smaller in size compared to code written in C

It can handle subnormal, NaN and Inf values. It passes basic testing but is not well tested for precision.

The original chibicc compiles C source code using stack-based operations, but also makes use of the many registers available on x64. This is inefficient on the MC6800, which has few registers and limited stack support. chibicc-6800-v1 optimizes code generation for the MC6800.

Fuzix-BinTools is required to assemble and link compiled objects.
For testing, we use emu6800 from Fuzix-Compiler-Kit.

# Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the environment for chibicc-6800.

## 1. Install Fuzix-Bintools

First, install [Fuzix-Bintools](https://github.com/EtchedPixels/Fuzix-Bintools).  
Please refer to the instructions in the Fuzix-Bintools repository's README.md for details.

Make sure that the installed binaries (e.g., `as6800`, `ld6800`) are available in your `$PATH`.

## 2. Install Fuzix-Compiler-Kit

Next, install [Fuzix-Compiler-Kit](https://github.com/EtchedPixels/Fuzix-Compiler-Kit).  
Please follow the installation instructions in the Fuzix-Compiler-Kit repository's README.md.

## 3. Install `emu6800` Emulator

After installing the Fuzix-Compiler-Kit, you need to install the `emu6800` emulator for testing.

Copy the emulator binary to the appropriate directory:

```sh
cp test/emu6800 /opt/fcc/bin/
```

> **Note:**  
> Make sure that `/opt/fcc/bin/` is included in your `$PATH` environment variable.

## 4. Verify Installation

You can verify that the tools are installed correctly by running:

```sh
which chibicc
which emu6800
which as6800
which ld6800
```

All commands should return the path to the respective binaries.

---

## Example: Running Test Programs

You can run all test programs automatically using the provided onetest script:

```sh
cd ztest
./onetest 9018-asciiartf.c
```

To run all tests, use runtest.

```sh
cd ztest
./runall
```

Alternatively, you can manually compile and run a test program as follows:

```sh
cd ztest
chibicc -v -O -o 9018-asciiartf.bin 9018-asciiartf.c
emu6800 6800 9018-asciiartf.bin 9018-asciiartf.map
```

This will compile the source file and execute the resulting binary using the emulator.

# Performance

## Integer Operations
- **Dhrystone benchmark:** 234 seconds at 1MHz on MC6800, equivalent to approximately 0.05 DMIPS.
- **Source code:** [`z88dk/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/EXAMPLES/benchmarks
/dhrystone21/`](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/EXAMPLES/benchmarks/dhrystone21)

- **Source code:** [`ztest/9018-asciiartf.c`](https://github.com/zu2/chibicc-6800-v1/blob/main/ztest/9018-asciiartf.c)  

- **Whetstone benchmark:** 449.5355 seconds at 1MHz on MC6800, equivalent to approximately 2.2245 KWIPS, .0022245 MWIPS
-- Improve: 2.7544 KWIPS, 0.027544 MWIPS (2025/06/12)
- **Source code:** [`z88dk/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/EXAMPLES/benchmarks/whetstone/`](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/EXAMPLES/benchmarks/whetstone)

## String and Memory Operations
- `strcmp`, `strcpy`, and `strcat` operate on two bytes at a time, resulting in high performance.
- Other `str*` and `mem*` functions are also implemented to minimize the number of comparisons and branches, further improving efficiency.

## Function Calls and Branching
- Despite the slow function prologue and epilogue, overall performance remains high.
- For `char` and `int`, direct branching is generated without relying on subroutines.
- For `long`, optimized subroutines are used for comparison, providing relatively fast execution.
- Recursive functions such as Ackermann ([`9005-ack.c`](https://github.com/zu2/chibicc-6800-v1/blob/main/ztest/9005-ack.c)) and Takeuchi's tarai ([`9100-tarai.c`](https://github.com/zu2/chibicc-6800-v1/blob/main/ztest/9100-tarai.c)) run efficiently, even with the overhead of function call setup and teardown.

## Details of Integer Arithmetic

- The MC6800 cannot directly transfer between AccAB and IX registers, and IX is required for stack data operations.
- A naive stack machine implementation would be slow, so chibicc-6800-v1 uses the IX register for address calculations whenever possible.
- For global variables and local variables with fixed offsets, AccAB is avoided as much as possible.
- Supports 32-bit `long`; does not support 64-bit `long long`.

## Details of Floating-Point Arithmetic

- Supports IEEE754 32-bit single-precision `float`.
- Only round-to-nearest mode is supported.
- Handles subnormal numbers.
- Does not support `double` or `long double`.
- Currently implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, `fabsf`, `fsqrtf`, `floorf`, and `ceilf`. Other functions may be supported in the future.

The IEEE754 float implementation has passed the Paranoia test for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and sqrtf. Other parts are still in progress.

# Optimization Options

## Supported Optimization Flags

- The compiler supports the `-O` and `-Os` options for optimization.  
- You can also specify `-O0`, `-O1`, and `-O2`, but note that `-O2` is not yet implemented.  
- The default optimization level is `-O0`.

## Behavior of Each Option

- **`-O0`**:  
  No optimization is performed at this level. However, if `/opt/fcc/lib/copt` is available, chibicc will use it to perform peephole optimization, except when `-O0` is specified, in which case no optimization is applied.

- **`-O`, `-O1`, `-O2`**:  

  if `/opt/fcc/lib/copt` is available, chibicc will use it to perform peephole optimization

- **`-Os`**:  
  This option generates code aimed at minimizing the size of the object file. As a trade-off, the resulting code may run approximately 5%-25% slower.

# Memo

## Stack frame

This compiler, like the x86 version, uses the frame pointer (`@bp`) to access local variables and arguments.  
On the 6800, due to the limited number of registers, `@bp` is placed in the zero page.  
Unlike other 6800 compilers that obtain the stack position using `TSX`, chibicc-6800 uses `LDX @bp`.  
Although this makes the instruction one byte larger, the number of cycles required is the same.  
Furthermore, when arithmetic operations on the stack pointer are needed, omitting `STS` can offset the size difference.


### Key points:

- **Frame Pointer Usage:** Required for supporting `alloca` and Variable-Length Arrays (VLA).
- **Performance Tradeoff:** Functions with a frame pointer are slightly slower due to saving/restoring it during prologue/epilogue.
- **Comparison with Other Compilers:** CC68 and Fuzix CC use the stack pointer (SP) directly, which is more efficient but requires precise SP tracking.
- **Future Plans:** Support for `alloca`/VLA may be removed in favor of SP-only implementation for simplicity.

Since `alloca` and VLAs use stack space and the size isn't known in advance, accessing locals and arguments via the stack pointer becomes tricky after allocation.  
The frame pointer (@bp) helps by providing a stable reference point.  
VLAs are accessed through a pointer saved on the stack.  
When the function returns, the old frame pointer is used to restore the stack properly.

```
// @bp points old @bp,argument
//
// SP  -> stack top
//        alloca/VLA area
// @bp -> local var top
//             :
//        local var end
//        argment passed by register AB or @long (if any)
//        old @bp
//        return address
//        argment passed by stack
```

## Function Arguments Handling

In this implementation:

1. Function arguments are discarded by the caller (unlike CC68/Fuzix CC where this happens in the callee).
2. The caller performs stack adjustment using `INS`, which increases code size due to frequent calls.
3. The first argument of the function is passed in a register. If the first argument is 8-bit, it is passed in AccB. If it is 16-bit, it is passed in AccAB. If it is long/float, it is passed with 4byte @long area in zero page.

### Tradeoffs:

- **1 Argument:** Efficient; no `PUSH` needed.
- **2 Arguments:** Equivalent; one `PUSH` removed but requires an `INS`.
- **3+ Arguments:** Less efficient due to additional `INS`.

Register-based arguments are saved during the prologue and accessed as local variables within functions. Further optimizations in this area are possible.

### Function Arguments Handling

Adjusting the stack in the called function can make the return process trickier. Instead of just using `RTS`, you'll need extra instructions like `TSX/LDX 0,X/INS.../JMP 0,X`. However, if many `INS` instructions are required, the difference in how the callee restores the stack becomes less significant.

## float/long in zero page

long/float are handled as 4byte variables (@long) on the zero page.

This is different from the CC68 and Fuzix CC methods. They are handled using AccA/B and as 2-byte values on the zero page.

When Acc A/B are used together, long/int mixed operations are advantageous.

For example, sign-extend int to long.

```
    ldx #0
    tsta
    bpl L1
    dex
L1: stx @hireg
```

all bytes on zero page.

```
    ldx #0
    stab @long+3
    staa @long+2
    bpl L1
    dex
L1: stx @long
```

On the other hand, AccA/B are fragile, so they may need to be saved and restored when performing long/float operations.

In the chibicc-6800, everything is on the zero page for clarity.

`@long` is also used when passing function arguments via registers. If the first (most significant) argument of a function is a `long` or `float`, it is passed through `@long`. This avoids the need for a 4-byte long push and multiple `ins` instructions.

### Passing long/float Arguments

When calling a function with a long or float argument using register passing, a zero page area (@long) is used for the argument. If the return value of one function is passed directly as an argument to the next function, the call can be made without any additional cost.

For example:

```
#include "float.h"
#include "math.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    float x=-2.0;
    float z;

    z = sqrtf(fabsf(x));
}
```

After storing the value of x into @long, we can call fabsf and then sqrtf in sequence. There is no need to restore the stack, making the operation efficient.

```
    ldab 7,x
    stab @long+3
    ldab 6,x
    stab @long+2
    ldab 5,x
    stab @long+1
    ldab 4,x
    stab @long
    jsr _fabsf
    jsr _sqrtf
```


## Conditional branch

8bit/16bit Integer's conditional branching is fast. It uses direct comparisons (not subroutines). 

For longs and floats, a subroutine is called for comparisons, but the code is written to reduce the number of comparisons as much as possible, so it is fast enough.

For example, take a look at some of the code generated by ztest/9100-tarai.c

```
int tarai(int x, int y, int z)
{
	if (x>y){
		return tarai(
			tarai(x-1,y,z),
			tarai(y-1,z,x),
			tarai(z-1,x,y));
	}
	return y;
}
```

Branches "if (x\>y)" are converted to jge (bge) instructions.

x\>y and x>=y have different branch costs. x-y>=0 requires one bge, but x-y>0 requires multiple branch instructions. The chibicc-6800 reduces the branch cost by treating the former as y-x\<0.

```
	ldab 9,x
	ldaa 8,x
	subb 3,x
	sbca 2,x
	jge L_end_5
	ldab 9,x
	ldaa 8,x
	pshb
	psha
	ldab 3,x
	ldaa 2,x
	pshb
	psha
	ldab 11,x
	ldaa 10,x
	subb #<1
	sbca #>1
	jsr _tarai
	ins
	ins
	ins
	ins
```

## Float

The `float` type follows the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision floating-point numbers, supporting both normalized and subnormal values.

IEEE 754 32-bit floating-point arithmetic code is written in assembler, which is faster and also smaller in size compared to code written in C

Currently, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison, absolute value (fabs), and square root (sqrtf) are implemented. Other functions are under consideration.

Float can handle subnormal, NaN and Inf values. It passes basic testing.


## Large size object / local area

IX addressing can only use offsets from 0 to 255, so there are limitations. If an offset greater than 255 is needed, calculations using AccAB are required, which leads to less efficient code.

- When returning a struct or union from a function, its size must be less than 256 bytes.
- When the total size of local variables and arguments is more than 252 bytes, certain limitations apply.
- Local area refers to temporary variables, including those allocated by assignment, alloca, or variable-length arrays (VLA).

Below is Rui's original README.md.

# chibicc: A Small C Compiler

(The old master has moved to
[historical/old](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/tree/historical/old)
branch. This is a new one uploaded in September 2020.)

chibicc is yet another small C compiler that implements most C11
features. Even though it still probably falls into the "toy compilers"
category just like other small compilers do, chibicc can compile
several real-world programs, including [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org),
[libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) and chibicc
itself, without making modifications to the compiled programs.
Generated executables of these programs pass their corresponding test
suites. So, chibicc actually supports a wide variety of C11 features
and is able to compile hundreds of thousands of lines of real-world C
code correctly.

chibicc is developed as the reference implementation for a book I'm
currently writing about the C compiler and the low-level programming.
The book covers the vast topic with an incremental approach; in the first
chapter, readers will implement a "compiler" that accepts just a single
number as a "language", which will then gain one feature at a time in each
section of the book until the language that the compiler accepts matches
what the C11 spec specifies. I took this incremental approach from [the
paper](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf) by Abdulaziz
Ghuloum.

Each commit of this project corresponds to a section of the book. For this
purpose, not only the final state of the project but each commit was
carefully written with readability in mind. Readers should be able to learn
how a C language feature can be implemented just by reading one or a few
commits of this project. For example, this is how
[while](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/773115ab2a9c4b96f804311b95b20e9771f0190a),
[[]](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/75fbd3dd6efde12eac8225d8b5723093836170a5),
[?:](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/1d0e942fd567a35d296d0f10b7693e98b3dd037c),
and [thread-local
variable](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/79644e54cc1805e54428cde68b20d6d493b76d34)
are implemented. If you have plenty of spare time, it might be fun to read
it from the [first
commit](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc/commit/0522e2d77e3ab82d3b80a5be8dbbdc8d4180561c).

If you like this project, please consider purchasing a copy of the book
when it becomes available! 😀 I publish the source code here to give people
early access to it, because I was planing to do that anyway with a
permissive open-source license after publishing the book. If I don't charge
for the source code, it doesn't make much sense to me to keep it private. I
hope to publish the book in 2021.
You can sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sgrMWHGeGjeeEJcX7) to receive a
notification when a free chapter is available online or the book is published.

I pronounce chibicc as _chee bee cee cee_. "chibi" means "mini" or
"small" in Japanese. "cc" stands for C compiler.

## Status

chibicc supports almost all mandatory features and most optional
features of C11 as well as a few GCC language extensions.

Features that are often missing in a small compiler but supported by
chibicc include (but not limited to):

- Preprocessor
- float, double and long double (x87 80-bit floating point numbers)
- Bit-fields
- alloca()
- Variable-length arrays
- Compound literals
- Thread-local variables
- Atomic variables
- Common symbols
- Designated initializers
- L, u, U and u8 string literals
- Functions that take or return structs as values, as specified by the
  x86-64 SystemV ABI

chibicc does not support complex numbers, K&R-style function prototypes
and GCC-style inline assembly. Digraphs and trigraphs are intentionally
left out.

chibicc outputs a simple but nice error message when it finds an error in
source code.

There's no optimization pass. chibicc emits terrible code which is probably
twice or more slower than GCC's output. I have a plan to add an
optimization pass once the frontend is done.

I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 for x86-64 as a development platform. I made a
few small changes so that chibicc works on Ubuntu 18.04, Fedora 32 and
Gentoo 2.6, but portability is not my goal at this moment. It may or
may not work on systems other than Ubuntu 20.04.

## Internals

chibicc consists of the following stages:

- Tokenize: A tokenizer takes a string as an input, breaks it into a list
  of tokens and returns them.

- Preprocess: A preprocessor takes as an input a list of tokens and output
  a new list of macro-expanded tokens. It interprets preprocessor
  directives while expanding macros.

- Parse: A recursive descendent parser constructs abstract syntax trees
  from the output of the preprocessor. It also adds a type to each AST
  node.

- Codegen: A code generator emits an assembly text for given AST nodes.

## Contributing

When I find a bug in this compiler, I go back to the original commit that
introduced the bug and rewrite the commit history as if there were no such
bug from the beginning. This is an unusual way of fixing bugs, but as a
part of a book, it is important to keep every commit bug-free.

Thus, I do not take pull requests in this repo. You can send me a pull
request if you find a bug, but it is very likely that I will read your
patch and then apply that to my previous commits by rewriting history. I'll
credit your name somewhere, but your changes will be rewritten by me before
submitted to this repository.

Also, please assume that I will occasionally force-push my local repository
to this public one to rewrite history. If you clone this project and make
local commits on top of it, your changes will have to be rebased by hand
when I force-push new commits.

## Design principles

chibicc's core value is its simplicity and the reability of its source
code. To achieve this goal, I was careful not to be too clever when
writing code. Let me explain what that means.

Oftentimes, as you get used to the code base, you are tempted to
_improve_ the code using more abstractions and clever tricks.
But that kind of _improvements_ don't always improve readability for
first-time readers and can actually hurts it. I tried to avoid the
pitfall as much as possible. I wrote this code not for me but for
first-time readers.

If you take a look at the source code, you'll find a couple of
dumb-looking pieces of code. These are written intentionally that way
(but at some places I might be actually missing something,
though). Here is a few notable examples:

- The recursive descendent parser contains many similar-looking functions
  for similar-looking generative grammar rules. You might be tempted
  to _improve_ it to reduce the duplication using higher-order functions
  or macros, but I thought that that's too complicated. It's better to
  allow small duplications instead.

- chibicc doesn't try too hard to save memory. An entire input source
  file is read to memory first before the tokenizer kicks in, for example.

- Slow algorithms are fine if we know that n isn't too big.
  For example, we use a linked list as a set in the preprocessor, so
  the membership check takes O(n) where n is the size of the set.  But
  that's fine because we know n is usually very small.
  And even if n can be very big, I stick with a simple slow algorithm
  until it is proved by benchmarks that that's a bottleneck.

- Each AST node type uses only a few members of the `Node` struct members.
  Other unused `Node` members are just a waste of memory at runtime.
  We could save memory using unions, but I decided to simply put everything
  in the same struct instead. I believe the inefficiency is negligible.
  Even if it matters, we can always change the code to use unions
  at any time. I wanted to avoid premature optimization.

- chibicc always allocates heap memory using `calloc`, which is a
  variant of `malloc` that clears memory with zero. `calloc` is
  slightly slower than `malloc`, but that should be neligible.

- Last but not least, chibicc allocates memory using `calloc` but never
  calls `free`. Allocated heap memory is not freed until the process exits.
  I'm sure that this memory management policy (or lack thereof) looks
  very odd, but it makes sense for short-lived programs such as compilers.
  DMD, a compiler for the D programming language, uses the same memory
  management scheme for the same reason, for example [1].
